# Roads between cities (Interval Trees)
Academic Project for the subject Data Structures and Algorithms. We have implemented a small map using pygame GUI and checked
if the cities are connected by a road.

## Data Structure
We have used the Data Structure Interval Tree to implement the searching of connecting roads in the maps.

## Execution
To execute the program, you need to install pygame. It can be done by using pip.
```bash
pip install pygame
```
To run the program just type in the following command in the terminal.
```bash
python main.py
```
